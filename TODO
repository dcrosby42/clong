Features:

- Fire bullets from paddles
- Effect on paddle strike
- Effect on wall strike
- Effect on goal strike
- Light randomization of initial ball launch
/ Delay ball instantiation and launch until Enter
/ Deflect off ceiling and floor
/ Count score when goal is struck
/ Display score counter
/ Pause on space

Tech:
- Bring "graph" plumbing library in
- Collision detection should be outside the specific upater for ball?

Smells:
- Paused and Ready state repeat the update-mode logic
- Paused/playing/ready updaters all call the same update-mode function, which then branches internally on state
  -> seems like there could be a more cause-effect relationship
- controller-mapping is a global valuer referenced from several tier2 update functions
