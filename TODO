Features:

- Delay ball instantiation and launch until Enter
- Light randomization of initial ball launch
/ Deflect off ceiling and floor
/ Count score when goal is struck
/ Display score counter
/ Pause on space
- Fire bullets from paddles

Tech:
- Bring "graph" plumbing library in
- Collision detection should be outside the specific upater for ball?

Smells:
- Paused and Ready state repeat the update-mode logic
- Paused/playing/ready updaters all call the same update-mode function, which then branches internally on state
  -> seems like there could be a more cause-effect relationship
